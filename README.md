# PSO Algorithm in C++

## Description
I had to create functions that would allow the development of the algorithm, such as vector manipulation, parameter variation, etc...

## Introduction to PSO Algorithm
Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the bio-inspired algorithms and it is a simple one to search for an optimal solution in the solution space. It is different from other optimization algorithms in such a way that only the objective function is needed and it is not dependent on the gradient or any differential form of the objective. It also has very few hyperparameters.
